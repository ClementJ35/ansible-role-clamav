# Debian and Kali ship with an AppArmor profile for /usr/bin/freshclam
# that, when applied to /usr/bin/freshclam running in a Docker
# container, does not allow /usr/bin/freshclam to query DNS.  (The
# same profile works as expected when run outside of Docker on a
# Debian or Kali AMI.)  This obviously interferes with the downloading
# of updated ClamAV databases and breaks this Ansible role.  Until we
# can figure out exactly what is happening, the only remedy I have
# found is to disable the AppArmor profile for /usr/bin/freshclam.
#
# Ideally this problem will eventually be either sorted out by us or
# fixed upstream, and we can remove this block.
#
# Note that we need not do anything if AppArmor is not enabled in the
# kernel.
